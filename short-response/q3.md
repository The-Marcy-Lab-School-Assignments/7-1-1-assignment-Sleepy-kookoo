# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer

Using `*` is only appropriate when creating a not found page. It takes in anything that is not an actually functioning url page. 


# Feedback

Yes and also if any url that is passed in is not valid, the user will land on the not found page.
