# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

I believe path 2 and 3 would match the `/products/:id` because React Router will match any non-empty string in place of :id. Path 4 will not work because it has an additionally `/`.
